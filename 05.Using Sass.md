## Using Sass

### Using Variables

Variables reduce the need for you to repeat the same properties across different areas. The reason why you should use them is self explanatory once you know how to use them. Let's have a look. 

Variables are declared with a `$` in front of the variable name.

~~~css
$variable: 20px;
~~~

From here on, you can use `$variable` anywhere in your SCSS code and its value will be compiled to `20px`.

~~~css
// SCSS
.test {
  font-size: $variable;
}
~~~

This outputs as

~~~css
/* CSS */
.test {
  font-size: 20px;
}
~~~

You can store any value within variables. You can even store font families and other strings, numbers or even colors that you would like to repeat throughout the website. Very useful stuff.

Next, let's have a look at mixins. 

### Using Mixins

Mixins are shortcuts that help you write multiple CSS properties at once. They are a convenient way to allow you to write less, and yet, output the properties you need to CSS.

Mixins are defined with the `@mixin` key, followed by the mixin name and any arguments.

~~~css
// Defining a mixin (SCSS)
@mixin color($color) {
  color: $color
}
~~~

Seasoned programmers will notice the resemblance to regular programming languages. $color is a variable that is defined for this particular mixin, and can be used within the mixin itself.

You can use mixins by adding `@include` followed by the mixin name and any arguments it may hold. Some mixins can be used without selectors while others have to be used within selectors.

~~~css
// Using a mixin (SCSS)
.test {
  @include color(red);
}
~~~

~~~css
/* CSS */
.test {
  color: red;
}
~~~

Mixins are often used to make more complex properties that require the output of more than one property. They can also contain functions and logic to output certain properties when a condition holds true, which allows for very complex programming to take place.

### Using Functions

Sass provides us with functions that we can use to return a specific value. Functions help us do complex calculations and returns a value that we can use somewhere else within the Sass code. 

Functions are defined with the `@function` key, followed by the function name and any arguments required.

~~~css
// Defining a function (SCSS)
@function multiply-by-two($number) {
  @return $number * 2;
}
~~~

You use functions by writing the function name along with its arguments like `multiply-by-two(20px);`.

~~~css
// Using a function
.test {
  width: multiply-by-two(20px)
}
~~~

~~~css
.test {
  width: 40px;
}
~~~

There are other ways of using functions, but in this book, we are only using functions in this way.
