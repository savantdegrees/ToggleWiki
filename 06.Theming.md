## Theming 

There are two sets of themes in Toggle. The dark theme and the light theme. 

Within each theme, there's a possiblity of using different theme colors, like red for Channel 8 and blue for Channel 5. 

Because of this, we have used a two-mixin approach to theming. 

First, we use the `tui` (Toggle UI) mixin to ensure that styles are correct for dark and light themes. 

Say we want to ensure that border colors are correct. 

~~~scss
.component {
  @include tui {
    border-color: $secondary-color;
  }
}
~~~

Second, we use the `tdc` (Toggle Dominant Color) mixin to ensure that correct color is used for each channel. 

~~~scss
.component {
  @include tdc {
    color: $theme-color;
  }
}
~~~

Both of these are located within `_theme.scss`. 

#### Body Classes for Theming 

To allow to this theming method, we need to add some classes to the body. 

First, we must make sure that Toggle is either the light or dark theme. 

theme      | classes
-----------|---------
light-theme| .light-theme .lightbg 
dark-theme | .dark-theme .darkbg

Second, we must make sure that Toggle has either one of the color themes: 

theme         | classes
--------------|---------
light-theme   | .primary
dark-theme    | .primary-dark
entertainment | .entertainment 
lifestyle     | .lifestyle
