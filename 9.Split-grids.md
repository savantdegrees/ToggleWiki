# Split Grids

Toggle has a unique grid called Split grid that is build specifically to transfer showcase ad from the sidebar to the content on a smaller viewport. 

The requirements are: 
- origination div must have `.split-grid` class 
- target will be `.split-insert` div 
- `split-index` values of the component being moved from the originating div must be the same as the `split-index` from the target div. 
- `split-index` values are integers.
