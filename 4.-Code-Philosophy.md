### BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

BEM is an acronym for block, element and modifier. It is a naming convention that uses double underscores `(__)` and double dashes `(--)` to create related classes. 

Each component is a block. Say we are making a toggle teaser component. 

~~~html
<!-- Html -->
<div class="tg-teaser"></div>
~~~

~~~scss
// Sass
.tg-teaser {}
~~~

It's childrens are given the double underscores. 

~~~html
<!-- Html -->
<div class="tg-teaser">
  <div class="tg-teaser__header"></div>
</div>
~~~

~~~scss
// Sass
.tg-teaser__header {}
~~~

If a modifier needs to be given, it uses double dashes. 

~~~html
<!-- Html -->
<div class="tg-teaser--modified">
  <div class="tg-teaser__header"></div>
</div>
~~~

~~~scss
// Sass
.tg-teaser--modified {
  // This ensures that all styles that tg-teaser has is inherited into tg-teaser-modified
  @extend .tg-teaser;
}
~~~

That's BEM in a nutshell. 

### Media Queries 

As much as possible we use `min-width` media queries that cascades upwards towards larger screens. 

This will also ensure that styles will be displayed mobile first (which usually has a slower connection compared to pc)

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  // stuff
}

We do media queries with [breakpoint-sass](http://breakpoint-sass.com) to make writing media queries simple. 

We can write this sass instead: 

~~~
@include breakpoint(600px) {
  // stuff
}
~~~

Sometimes we use `max-width`  media queries if we want a certain style to _only_ apply in a certain viewport. 

For example, if we want some styles to only appear in mobile, we do this: 

~~~
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  // stuff
}
~~~

With breakpoints, we write this: 

~~~
@include breakpoint(max-width 480px) {
  // stuff
}
