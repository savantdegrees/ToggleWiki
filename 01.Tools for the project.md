It allows you to use functions, mixins and logic in CSS that was previously not possible.

### Susy 

Susy is a grid layout engine. It's like a super calculate that allows you to layout with CSS. 

Basically it helps to make layouts. 

This allows us to separate content vs styles and keeps the HTML as simple as possible. Using Susy helps with integration with the backend since we don't have to change the HTML as much.
