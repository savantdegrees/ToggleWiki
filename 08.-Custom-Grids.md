## Custom Grids 

In addition to using the grids that are currently provided, you can feel free to add your own customized grids. The quickest way to get the correct column sizing is with Susy. 

## Using Susy 

The easiest way to use Susy is to use the `span()` mixin to create the grids. For example, say we want to create a 3 column that has the following configurations: 

1st column -> 2 of 12 columns
2nd column -> 8 of 12 columns
3rd column -> 2 of 12 columns 

The Sass will be

~~~scss
.new-grid {
  .l-gi:first-child {
	  @include span(2 first);
  }
  .l-gi:nth-child(2) {
	  @include span(8 at 3);
  }
  .l-gi:last-child {
	  @include span(2 last);
  }
}
~~~
